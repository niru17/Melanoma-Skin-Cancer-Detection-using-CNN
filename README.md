# Melanoma-Skin-Cancer-Detection-using-CNN
The code is designed to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from a dataset of melanoma skin cancer images. Here's a step-by-step explanation of what the code does:

1. Library Imports

Various libraries are imported for numerical computations, data manipulation, visualization, image processing, deep learning, and accessing data from Google Drive.

2. Mount Google Drive

The Google Drive is mounted to access the dataset stored there.

3. Define Paths

The paths to the training and test datasets are specified.

4. Load Dataset

A function is defined to load the dataset from the specified path. It collects image paths and their corresponding class labels, storing them in a dictionary. This dictionary is then converted to a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation.

5. Display Images

A function is created to display a grid of sample images from the dataset. This helps in visualizing the images before any preprocessing or augmentation.

6. Image Transformations

Image augmentation techniques are defined using the Albumentations library. These transformations include rotations, flips, cropping, blurring, and resizing to enhance the diversity of the training data.

7. Create Data Generators

Data generators are created to load and augment images in batches for training and validation. These generators apply the defined transformations to the images.

8. Split Data

The dataset is split into training and validation sets. This allows the model to be trained on one set of images and validated on another to assess its performance.

9. Display Augmented Images

Another function is defined to display a grid of augmented images from the data loader. This helps in visualizing the images after preprocessing and augmentation.

10. Build the Model

A convolutional neural network model is built using VGG16 as the base model. Additional fully connected layers are added on top of VGG16 for classification. The model is designed to classify images into two categories.

11. Compile the Model

The model is compiled with a specific optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metric. Callbacks are also set up to monitor the training process and make adjustments, such as reducing the learning rate or stopping early if the validation loss does not improve.

12. Train the Model

The model is trained using the training data loader. During training, the model's performance is evaluated on the validation data. The best model is saved based on validation performance, and the training process is adjusted using the defined callbacks.
